This repository aims at creating tools for solving and creating Nonograms. This is a personnal project from me with the additionnal constraint of not looking for solutions from internet nore AI. This has been a lot of fun and a lot of lost nights ;)

My initial approach was more of a "let's that get done quickly" but right now I feel the need to clean stuff, add comments, separate files and build stronger tests as well as planning for user-interaction fonctionnalities. Hence I initiated a git repo, quite late. Let's see how it goes!

TODO:
=== Functionnality ===
Finally complete check_line() with a 0-depth hypothesis check.
Let some basic information be stored in the Nonogram file (mostly Uniqueness)
Check similarities in both sides after a guess
Add the possibility to Highlight a line after an error has been detected
Interactivity
=> Make all guesses without applying any conclusions.
=> Store in HH and show in the grid. Let the user choose where to guess based on that.

=== cleaness ===
Store the solutions along the way
Add a Silence mode
Shorten te last-cycle before recursion.
--> upon Modif: All "previous" guesses are non-valid, right?
    ==> Mark currentGuess during modif and when cycled again: only until that mark.
Read parameters from commands instead of in the code through macros

=== other ===
Edit this README to add examples, instalation guides and tutorials
Create the Python app usefull for converting pictures into Nonograms - long term goal ;)
