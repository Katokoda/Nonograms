This repository aims at creating tools for solving and creating Nonograms. This is a personnal project from me with the additionnal constraint of not looking for solutions from internet nore AI. This has been a lot of fun and a lot of lost nights ;)

My initial approach was more of a "let's that get done quickly" but right now I feel the need to clean stuff, add comments, separate files and build stronger tests as well as planning for user-interaction fonctionnalities. Hence I initiated a git repo, quite late. Let's see how it goes!

TODO:
=== Functionnality ===
Let some basic information be stored in the Nonogram file (mostly Uniqueness)
Store the solutions along the way
Add a Silence mode
Check similarities in both sides after a guess
Remove the useless Lsolve() after Stuck-Stuck
!!! --> Achievable cleanly by making "change" into a state-variable, distinct for both dimensions
Add the possibility to Highlight a cell during state.print()
Add the possibility to Highlight a line after an error has been detected

=== cleanless ===
Read parameters from commands instead of in the code through macros

=== other ===
Edit this README to add examples, instalation guides and tutorials
Create the Python app usefull for converting pictures into Nonograms - long term goal ;)
